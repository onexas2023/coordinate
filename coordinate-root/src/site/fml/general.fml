      <question>
        What is RedQueryBuilder?
      </question>
      <answer>
        RedQueryBuilder fills the gap between a hand coded "quick search" and a full blown query language. A typical use is in an intranet web application where experienced users need a quick ad-hoc way to find particular data. This means they don't have to use report frameworks or ask a techie.

    <faq id="licence">
      <question>
        What licence covers RedQueryBuilder?
      </question>
      <answer>
        Currently it is freeware. We hope to resolve a couple of issues then release source
        under a licence like LGPL. However there is currently no deadline for this change.

    <faq id="meta-data-source">
        <question>
            Where do I get the meta data from?
        </question>
        <answer>
            You can either generate the meta data from your database meta data
            (this is what the appengine demo does) or create it by hand.
            Either way you can produce JSON or use the Configuration.nocache.js JavaScript
            code to create the correct objects.

    <faq id="only-one-table">
        <question>
            I only want the users to search one table. How do I remove the From selector.
        </question>
        <answer>
            The primary API to RQB is SQL so you could use RedQueryBuilderFactory to set the
            initial SQL to select the correct table and optionally setup a starting
            point expression.
            If you then want to hide the selector you can either use CSS to hide to hide
            the element with the class name &quot;rqbFrom&quot; or set visible to false 
            in the From configuration.

    <faq id="only-expression">
        <question>
            I only want the SQL after the WHERE clause. Is there an option to do this?
        </question>
        <answer>
            In general it best to use a tool designed to manipulate SQL (i.e. Parser to generate parse tree).
            However RQB will always generate a &quot;\n&quot; before a keyword.
            So the WHERE clause can be found by searching for &quot;\nWHERE &quot;.
